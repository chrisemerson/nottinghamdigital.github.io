## Guidelines to Event descriptions and Titles

1. Link title to the relevant site / Meetup page
2. Keep sentences and paragraphs short and easy to scan
2. Double check your spelling
3. Feel free to include social media links after the title
4. Respect other meetups and the community spirit of what we're trying to achieve as a collaborative, supportive group of organisers. Refrain from any content that is not in keeping with this aim - if further advice is needed raise a comment in your PR
5. If your event uses meetup or tito - include details in the PR and your listings will get pulled from there or make a separate PR on [https://github.com/pavlakis/notts-digital/blob/master/app/configs/groups.php]: the api groups configuration
6. Ensure your meetup is in Nottingham or the immediate area.

## Guidelines to code / markup 

1. Commits must be accompanied by meaningful commit messages

2. PRs that include bug fixing should be accompanied by a step-by-step description of how to reproduce the bug.
